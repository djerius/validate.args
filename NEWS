1.2.5 :

  things to be validated against the same specification

* vfunc callback is passed as an extra argument a table with additional info

* user provided functions may be called prior to and after the validation
  process for each argument in the validation specification

1.2.0 :

[API CHANGE]

* validate_opts: options which are now set reflect the *current*
  values as set by opts(), not the default values.  the baseOptions
  option is no longer supported.  Use the new object-oriented
  interface to duplicate the old functionality

[ENHANCEMENTS]

* validate.args now provides an object-oriented API as well as a
  procedural API.  This makes it easier to create isolated validation
  schemes.


1.1.0 :

[API CHANGE]

* type check functions may now return an error message upon
  failure. older code which simply returns the passed argument
  as the second return value will see that argument output in the
  error message.  See the updated docs for more information.
